1. Always use little endian
2. Always use standard data types
3. Always have a header
4. This will be a binary format
5. Python must use "struct" and explicitly assign little endian when packing or unpacking.

# TODO: determine if should use one struct for requesting data and one for sending or to use one for both.
# This is for sensor data
